## Dashboard Usecases

### Teacher

- Can view the classrooms that have been created by him/her.
- Can delete/update the name if required.
- Can create a test. This coding test will contain questions that consist of description of the problem statement, example, test cases (upfront and hidden). The test will have a start date and time, and a end date and time.
- This test can be updated (question/timings) and deleted as well.
- The teacher will also decide which language will the test be allowed in. (not urgent)

- Upon submitting the test by the students, the teacher can view the results, how many questions were done and what was the result.
- Grading? (feature)

### Student
- Can join a classroom, can see his upcoming tests.
- Can receive email reminders about upcoming tests (feature)
- Can attempt a test, the timer will start. The timer should now remember how much time is left irrespective of the number of times the website is closed in between.
- Can sumbit a question to see the results of the test cases.
- Can finish the test.
